Hello :)

Want a great tutorial on [Using Webpack's Hot Module Replacement with
React?][blog-link].

[blog-link]: http://matthewlehner.net/react-hot-module-replacement-with-webpack/

To run:

- clone the repo
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
- visit http://localhost:8080
- edit any of the components in the `render` method of `./src/index.js` and see HMR at work.



Pull requests welcome!
